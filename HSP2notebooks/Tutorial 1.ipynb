    "\n",
    "A conference paper describing HSP$^2$ is available [here](TutorialData/JasonWEFTEC 2014.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "Both people and the ecological integrity of aquatic systems rely on healthy watersheds. Strategic protection and water-quality improvement in the nation’s watersheds—rivers, lakes, wetlands, and streams, as well as in our estuarine, coastal, and ocean waters—require holistic, integrated solutions that emphasize accountability. One of the EPA’s key objectives is improving watershed-based approaches.\n",
    " \n",
    "Watershed-scale environmental models are increasingly being used to assist in developing watershed-based approaches for protecting and restoring our nation’s waterbodies. Anticipating environmental problems by developing and applying mathematical models to simulate pollutant movement through a watershed has been the subject of intensive EPA research for decades. An outcome of these efforts is the Hydrological Simulation Program – FORTRAN (HSPF), which is an important tool in watershed-based assessment and planning. HSPF is thought to be the most accurate and appropriate management tool presently available for the continuous simulation of hydrology and water quality in watersheds.\n",
    " \n",
    "Since its initial development over 30 years ago, the HSPF model has been applied throughout North America as well as in numerous countries and climatic regimes around the world. In North America, it is a key model used in developing complex total maximum daily load (TMDL) assessments and for assessing the effectiveness of restoration scenarios. For more than \n",
    "2 decades, an HSPF-based watershed model has been used to simulate nutrient and sediment load delivery to the Chesapeake Bay as part of the Chesapeake Bay restoration effort. HSPF uses information such as the time history of rainfall, temperature, evaporation, and parameters related to land-use patterns, soil characteristics, and agricultural practices to simulate the processes that occur in a watershed. The initial result of an HSPF simulation is a time history of the quantity and quality of water that is transported over the land surface and through various soil zones down to the groundwater aquifers. Runoff flow rate, sediment loads, nutrients, pesticides, toxic chemicals, and other quality constituent concentrations can be predicted. The model uses these results and stream channel information to simulate instream processes such as hydraulics, sediment transport, and nutrient cycling. From this information, HSPF produces a time history of water quantity and quality at any point in the watershed. "

    "### HSPF Issues\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hydrological Simulation Program -- Fortran (HSPF) is a great tool and was very well designed.\n",
    "However, HSPF had constrants that were necessary in order to run under the limitations of the computers available when it was developed. These constrains prevent it from evolving for current needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most significant HSPF issues include:\n",
    "+ The current HSPF model is over one hundred thousand lines of Fortran-77 code. Much of this is not hydrologic/engineering code.\n",
    "+ The old Fortran common block architecture makes adding modules difficult and error prone.\n",
    "+ The user input file (UCI) is based on 80 column punch card 'Tables'. It is difficult to add new data or extend the size of existing data. The PERLND section alone has over 130 distinct tables. The number of UCI table types make it hard to learn and manage.\n",
    "+ Time series data has been stored in a number of different formats which are not standard outside the hydrology community. The Watershed Data Management (WDM) files are size limited (32 bit architecture), limited functionality, and difficult to use. WDM files are not readable by tools such as MATLAB without special libraries which do not have strong support.\n",
    "+ Names for PLS, ILS, and RID segments, timeseries names, and FTABLE names are inflexible.\n",
    "+ The Fortran originally used in HSPF had no dynamic capability, so all arrays had fixed sizes. Fixed sized arrays imposed fixed limits on all elements of HSPF (such as the maximum number of OP_SEQ elements, the number of outlets from a reach, the size of FTables, the naming of segments in a PERLND, etc.)\n",
    "+ HSPF is difficult (although possible) to integrate with other hydrology simulation codes.\n",
    "+ HSPF doesn't support lumped and gridded watershed models.\n",
    "+ HSPF doesn't support mulicore CPUs and scientific GPUs. It doesn't support MPI for parallel operation in a cluster."

    "\n",
    "The overall goal of this project is to mitigate the aforementioned challenges that are currently facing the HSPF model so that it will continue to be a premiere watershed model into the foreseeable future. The major objectives to accomplish this goal and create the HSP2 (Hydrologic Simulation Program – Python) include the following:\n",
    "+ Convert HSPF to a modern computer language that runs on modern computers and operating systems. The choice is  Python.\n",
    "+ Retain all current HSPF functionality from the hydrologist's point of view. Provide a migration path from legacy applications. \n",
    "   + However, internal functionality that is invisible to the user, such as the Fortran-77 COMMON block, may be modified or deleted as necessary.\n",
    "   + Documentation within the new HSP$^2$ code is used to transparently show the translation path between HSPF and HSP$^2$.\n",
    "   \n",
    "+ Elevate the engineering code out of the non-engineering code to make the science in the model clear. The user should not be lost in the complexity of the memory management and the data input and output aspects of the code, HSP$^2$ should implement the HSPF algorithms as clearly and directly as possible. \n",
    "+ Restructure HSPF for maintainability, remove all fixed limits (for example, the number of OP Sequence operations) and remove naming constraints for model data and time-series. \n",
    "+ Provide users with greater capability to add their own data and modules.\n",
    "+ Save timeseries at the computed time steps for better post-run analysis\n",
    "+ Allow modern tools such as plotting tools that allow panning and zooming into the data to work easily with HSP2.\n",
    "+ Allow the integration of Geographical Information System data and tools with HSP2.\n",
    "+ Be independent of operating system and hardware. The goal is to have comparible execution time with HSPF.\n",

    "\n",
    "HDF5 (Hierarchical Data Format version 5) is the standard for most large scale scientific\n",
    "data storage.\n",
    "It was originally developed at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications. Now \n",
    "it is actively maintained by the non-profit [HDF Group](https://www.hdfgroup.org/) to insure its availability on new platforms and operating systems and for legacy systems. It is intended to be an archval storage format. The HDF group also supplies free utilities such as HDFView and HDFCompass. HDF5 won a R&D 100 award in 2002.\n",
    "\n",
    "> From the HDF Group website: *HDF5 is a unique technology suite that makes possible the management of extremely large and complex data collections.*\n",
    "\n",
    "HDF5 is supported by most science/engineering tools including MATLAB and Mathmatica. It is supported by most modern languages including Fortran, C, C++, Python, Java, R and Julia. Some modern digital instruments can output their data directly in HDF5 format. (The IVI Foundation sets specifications for test instruments and supports HDF5.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Several scientific data storage projects have changed their backends to use HDF5. For example,\n",
    "starting with version 4.0, netCDF can store its data as HDF5. Other examples include MODFLOW GMS, NeXus, HDF-EOS, PFEL COADS, EUMETNET OPERA, LOFAR, H5MD, H5VC, and MATLAB (stores its own data internally in HDF5).\n",
    "\n",
    "HDF5 is fast and has no practical size limitation (a working group is already actively extending HDF5 to support an exabyte of data in a single HDF5 file).  HDF files that are created or modified by any supported hardware,\n",
    "operating system, or 32/64 bit architecture may be sent to any other user on any supported hardware/operating system/architecture. \n",
    "\n",
    "All data transformations due to bit order, data length, and data representation (particularly the different floating point representations) are transparent to the user. Each dataset in a single HDF5 file may have its own choice of compression method, compression level or no compression. HDF5 supports queries that allow only a subset of data to be extracted from one or more datasets - query extraction does not require bringing a large dataset into CPU memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "HDF5 has been shown to be faster than modern databases for scientific data access. It is freqently used  for large scientific data (petabyte) storage. HDF5 allows annotating data and groups (directories) with an arbitrary number of key,value strings. Complex data structures can\n",
    "be represented by building up structures using the primitive types.\n",
    "\n",
    "HDF5 supports multiple backends for attaching to the actual hardware/software. These backends allow RAM based files, tradition filesystem files, parallel cluster I/O, and files that span many disks and computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although HDF5 has supports writing new datasets at any time, queries, and appending to existing datasets, it is not a database. It does not currently support roll backs, automatic backup or replication, and does not create transaction files. (Some of these features are scheduled for the future.)  Unlike a database which must support reading and writing of data with balanced performance, HDF5 uses the assumption that a dataset is written once (or only a few times), but is read many times. So its performance is very fast for reading data, but slower for writing. (Although a new feature in HDF5 does allow for very rapid data writing.)\n",
    "\n",
    "HSP$^2$ uses  HDF5 to store all simulation information including run control, simulation configuration (like old UCI data), input timeseries (like old WDM files), simulation results, and associated documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "HSP$^2$ utilities can import traditional HSPF UCI and WDM files from legacy watershed models into a HSP$^2$ HDF5 file. New watershed models will directly enter their data into HDF5 files. All simulation results specified by the user are saved to the HDF5 file. Analysis, reports and plots are generated post-run from the HDF5 using the Pandas Python library and othe tools."

    "HSP$^2$ is currently coded in Python 2.7. The standard Python distributions from Enthought (Canopy) and Continuum Analytics (Anaconda) are still based on Python 2.7. The scientific community is still converting many of the core scientific modules into Python 3.x.  When  these distributions are available in Python 3.x, HSP$^2$ will be converted to Python 3.x with little effort.\n",

DOE awarded a SBIR grant to Enthought to develop a  Python high performance computing (HPC) framework and to access Sandia's Trilinos solvers by Python. Both companies provide scientists and engineers with Python training. So this is a very active community of open source projects.  The new Moore and Sloan foundation Data Science initiative ($37.8 Million) will continue to extend the Jupyter Notebook and other critical Python (and non-Python) tools over the period of 2014-2019."

    "The [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org) (originally started as the IPython Notebook) is designed to be an electronic laboratory notebook and a tool for collaborative science and engineering. These Tutorials and some of the HSP2 support tools use it. It is possible to display graphics, audio, video, equations and to run code interactively. The Jupyter Project is being created to be the language agnostic version of the IPython Notebook.\n",

IBM and Continuum Analytics have dedicated developers to support the Jupyter team.\n",

    "[HDF5](https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5/) (Hierarchical Data Format v5) was chosen as a primary data storage file format for HSP2 model inputs and outputs. It is a high-performance, open binary format that has a long [history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_Data_Format) of use by academia, federal agencies, and industry. For more information on its selection, read [Why HSP2?: The Solution](https://github.com/respec/HSPsquared/wiki/Why-HSP2%3F#the-solution---hsp2).\n",

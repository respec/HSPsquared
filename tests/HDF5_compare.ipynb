    "HDF5 for HSP2 Input & Output Storage\n",
    "===\n",
    "\n",
    "[HDF5](https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5/) (Hierarchical Data Format v5) was chosen as a primary data storage file format for HSP2 model inputs and outputs. It is a high-performance, open binary format that has a long [history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_Data_Format) of use by academia, federal agencies, and industry. For more information on its selection, read [Why HSP2?: The Solution](https://github.com/respec/HSPsquared/wiki/Why-HSP2%3F#the-solution---hsp2).\n",
    "\n",
    "HDF5 has many benefits, but can nevertheless present challenges to new users. \n",
    "\n",
    "**This notebook demonstrates different approaches for opening and interacting with HDF5 files within the Python environment for HSP2** (i.e. the conda environment created by `environment_hsp2_py38.yml`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The [HDFView](https://www.hdfgroup.org/downloads/hdfview/) desktop utility software provides a visual HDF5 file browser that can support exploration of HDF5 files. We recommend downloading and using it."
